## T1059.001 IOC1 - Detect PowerShell Web Requests

## Author
https://github.com/SimpleInfoSec

## Description
This rule detects when PowerShell or PWSH are used to download files from the internet using the "Invoke-WebRequest" CMDLET or the "System.Net.WebClient method". 
This rule may serve as an IOC that an adversary has acheived initial access (ex. through a MalDoc) and is attempting execution of additional malicious code from the internet. 
This rule is helpful in detecting adversaries that are attempting to "live off the land" by using standard commands to "blend in" and avoid detection.

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
    Process {
        Include OBJECT_NAME { -v "*PowerShell*" }
        Include OBJECT_NAME { -v "*PWSH*" }
    }
    Target {
        Match PROCESS { 
            Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
            Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*Net.WebClient*"}
        }
    }
}
```

## Trigger
You can trigger this rule by opening CMD and running any of the following commands:
PowerShell "Invoke-WebRequest -URI www.McAfee.com"
"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7-preview\pwsh.exe" -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -URI www.McAfee.com"
Powershell -Command "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).OpenRead('https://www.McAfee.com')"
"C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7-preview\pwsh.exe" "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).OpenRead('https://www.McAfee.com')"

**Trigger Notes**: An adversary is probably going to use a method other than "OpenRead" (ex: the DownloadFile method), I just wanted provide POC code. 
I fully qualified the path to PWSH on my machine as it is not in my path variable, you may or may not need to do this. 

## Tested Platforms
Windows 10, ENS 10.7.x, PowerShell 5.1.17763.1490 & PWSH 7.2.0-preview.3

## Notes
This is intended to be a simple rule that provides an easy method to detect PowerShell initiating web requests, it is not all-encompassing and you may need to tune it a bit for your environment. 
There are many ways that adversaries use PowerShell to download files from the internet, and they will often attempt to obfuscate the purpose of the commands to evade detection. 
Even if you do not enable blocking for this rule, it can be used as an IOC to feed to a SIEM, trigger automatic responses in ePO, or trigger a playbook/workflow for follow-up analysis. 
I highly recommend reviewing the adversary technqiues associated with T1059.001 in the MITRE ATT&CK for additional code samples that you can use in your rules, and to better understand the
variety of ways that adversaries use PowerShell to download files from the internet.
