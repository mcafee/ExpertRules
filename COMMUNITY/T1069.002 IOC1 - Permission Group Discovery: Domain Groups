## T1069.002 IOC1 - Permission Group Discovery: Domain Groups

## Author
https://github.com/SimpleInfoSec

## Description
This rule detects the use of the Net executable to enumerate the "Domain admins" & "enterprise admins" security groups in Active Directory. 
Adversaries often use built-in executables (like Net) to perform discovery while "living off the land" in order to avoid detection. 

## Rule TCL
```tcl
Rule {
    Process {
        Include OBJECT_NAME { -v "Net.exe" }
        Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*group*"}
    }
    Target {
        Match PROCESS { 
            Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*Domain admins*" }
            Include PROCESS_CMD_LINE { -v "*enterprise admins*"}
        }
    }
}
```

## Trigger
You can trigger this rule by opening CMD, PowerShell, or PWSH and running the following commands:
net group "Domain admins" /DOMAIN
net group "enterprise admins" /DOMAIN

## Tested Platforms
Windows 10, ENS 10.7.x, PowerShell 5.1.17763.1490 & PWSH 7.2.0-preview.3

## Notes
This is intended to be a simple rule that alerts on abnormal enumeration of privileged domain groups. You can add other sensitive groups in your domain to the Target section
to customize this for your environment. The enumeration of the Domain Admins group using the net executable seems to be a common IOC shared by multiple APT's. I've moved this
rule to 'block' b/c there just isn't any legitimate use of Net to enumerate these groups in my environment, but you may be better suited just using it as an IOC.
